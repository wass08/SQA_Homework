Software Quality Assurance is not just a phase of testing after the development. Itâ€™s a full process that occurs from the beginning to the end of the project.

It ensures the project reliability to both external/consumers and internal/producers.

Software Quality itself can be summarised by the respect of perspectives, expectations and by the low defects of the project.

Many techniques are used to fulfil the SQA and to make the project results as a success.
