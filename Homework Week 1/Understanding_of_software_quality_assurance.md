# What do I unserdstand about SQA

**Software Quality Assurance** is not just a phase of testing after the development. It’s a **full process** that occurs **from the beginning to the end** of the project.

It ensures the **project reliability** to both **external**/consumers and **internal**/producers.

Software Quality itself can be summarised by the **respect of perspectives**, **expectations** and by **the low defects** of the project.

Many techniques are used to fulfil the SQA and to make the project results as a success.
