#Understanding of formal methods

	Some sensible programs require a perfect fiability, reliability which require the use of some formal methods.

	They can be mathematics, algorithmic, algebrical, or modeling tools in order to formally verify the programs and their algorithms.


	Formal methods is composed by the formal specification which is a part of defect prevention and the formal verification which is a part of QA but focused on positive.


Formal methods are technicals that help on software or hardware in order to demonstrate/validate that it match its requirement. They are based on formal program semantics which means it can be from the source code.

Those methods provide a high level of insurance of no defects/bugs. Otherwise, they are really costly in resources (humans or hardware) and are only used for criticals software. 


###Model checking

Model checking is a family technique of automated verification of dynamic systems. It is part of algorithmically verificate if a given model, the system itself or a system abstraction match a requirement.

We can distinguate two aspects of model checking :

 - Demonstrate a certain class property or logical belongs a certain class complexity
 
 - Search efficient algorithms on interesting cases, to implement them and to apply them to real problems.
 
Model checking exhaustively analyze system evolution on its execution (running time). By example, to demonstrate the no running time errors we could test the no error statement accessible on the system.
