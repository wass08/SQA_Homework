## Summary


Quality assurance is about defect measurement and analysis. It is part of **every processes** and last **the whole lifecycle of the project**.

Its different phases are :

* Defect prevention in early phases
* Focused defect removal in testing phase
* Defect containment in late phases
* Phase transitions: inspection/review/etc



We can divide its goals in two. One part would be **to meet the requirements** while in the other hand we want to have a **functionnal product**.

To be **efficient** in Software Quality Engineering, the main action is to set **Quality Goals** based on the **expectations** from the customers and users, the **market condition** and the **reliability** of the project.

In parallel of the developement it is important to watch everytime if it reaches the **fixed goals**.

Software Quality Engineering consists in **Quality Assurance** and includes the **QIP (Quality Improvement Paradigm)** ideas

**Different efforts** are required in different phases which means a huge **importance for the planning**.

But also importance of testing to **avoid any deffects**. Planning and preparation is important to setup different test cases to be executed and analyzed

Distinction between **functionnal** (input and expected output without knoweledge of how it works inside) and **structural testing** (importance of the internal implementation) can be made and **depends from the expectations**.
