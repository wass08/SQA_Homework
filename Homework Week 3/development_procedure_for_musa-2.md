Musa-2 is used for big software systems where the customers/users' experiences may be really different from one to another.

*OP = Operational Profile*

### 1 - Identify initiators of operations

* Human users
* Software
* Hardware
* Network
* Any other factor

### 2 - Determine tabular or graphical representation

**Simple representation** to determine **the type of OP**, more elaborated one will be done in the next steps.

### 3 - Operations lists

Creation of **operations lists**, those operations are obtained from the initiators identified during the **first step**.

### 4 - Occurence rate

This step is done to obtain the **frequency an individual operation occurs** in the operations' list.

### 5 - Occurence probability

**The occurence probability** from an individual operation is got by **normalizing** the data from the previous step.

As it is not always easy to get those information, surveys, expert opinions, or other way can be used to estimate those values.



## Differences between Musa-1 and Musa-2

**Musa-1** focuses on the **customer** and **defines 5 profiles** while **Musa-2** focuses on an **initiator** *(which can also be a user)* and contains **different elements** for each profile.
