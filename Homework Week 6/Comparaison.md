#Comparaison between Testing and Formal Verification



###Definition

	Formal verification

In the context of hardware and software systems, Formal Verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, using formal methods of mathematics.
	
	Testing
	
Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test.[1] Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include, but are not limited to the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects).
	
###Applicability

Depends on the environement, the costs and the benefit to apply each kind of techniques

	Formal verification

Check if the code design is well implemented. If the logic inside respect the formal expectations through some mathematical logics and questions.
The cost is high.
	
	Testing
	
Execute the code and check if the output is conform to what is expected.
The cost can be from low to high.

###Expertise

	Formal verification

High level of knowledge and expertise in general and about the project to check deeply inside the code.

	Testing
	
Low to high level of knowledge, but usually low, which correspond to respect testing cases.

###Efficiency 

	Formal verification

Human errors, can require fault absence verification in addition to the formal verification. Logical faults.

	Testing
	
Check the absence of fault and dynamic failures.
